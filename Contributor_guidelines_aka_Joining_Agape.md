## How to become a star member

To obtain the rank of a star member means getting recognition for your contributions to open science and Agape. To become a star member, you should gain at least 5 points for open science-related activities, at least 2 out of which must be related to Agape. You can gain multiple points for the same type of activity.

Examples:

| **Activity** | **Agape-related** | **Value** | **Proof to send** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-register a study or research project | no | 1 point | DOI |
| Publish a preprint of your study | no | 1 point | DOI |
| Co-author\* an open science-related article | no | 1 point | DOI |
| Publish your DMP | no | 1 point | DOI |
| Post a blog post on open science | yes or no, depending on where you post | 1 point | screenshot, email confirmation, etc. |
| Create an open science-related infographic and share it with others on Agape social media | yes, please use #agapeopenscience | 0.5 point | screenshot, SVG file |
| Organise an open science-related event/workshop/lecture/webinar | yes or no | 1-2 points | share info on our communication platform prior to the event/workshop/lecture/webinar |
| Contribution to GitHub, OSF or similar repositories | yes | 1 point | share a link or DOI |
| Your imagination should not be limited by these examples. If you are not sure if your activity would be rewarded with point(s) you can always confirm this with us via email. Of course, gaining points is a good motivation but you should proceed with your activity independently of our decision. | 

\* If you are the first author contact us to collect more points.

When you collect 5 or more points, please email proof of each to [agape.open.science@gmail.com](mailto:agape.open.science@gmail.com) and use "Star member" in the Subject of your email. Note: Points can be awarded retrospectively, e.g.: if you co-authored an open science article that was published before you joined Agape.

Once the core team evaluates your contributions a member of the core team will contact you to announce the outcome. If you have successfully gained at least 5 points you will officially become a star member. You will be emailed instructions on how to add a Star Member Agape logo into your email signature and on how to send us info for your star profile on the Agape website should you wish so.


## That's not all folks

We always want to hear from those with specific expertise or interests, such as web development, illustrations, social media management, project management, event organising, etc. If you are willing to share your skills and dedicate any amount of your time to the Agape community we will be excited to hear from you.

The same applies to anyone who would like to propose any open science-related activities, projects, and collaborations that we can work on together.
