# Code of conduct breach


## Involvement

Any member of the core team whom the reported breach of the code of conduct does not include will seek to find a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question. If asked for, other core team members will get involved in the decision making process.


## Community impact guidelines

The core team member(s) may follow these community impact guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of the code of conduct:


### 1. Correction

Community impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.


### 2. Warning

Community impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.


### 3. Temporary ban

Community impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.


### 4. Permanent ban

Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.


## Resolution

The community impact guidelines are only a tool to help to make a decision and each report should be investigated, considered, and resolved individually. Possible resolution may include:

- A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.
- A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.
- A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the code of conduct.
- Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of the code of conduct.
- A private in-person conversation between a member of the core team and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
- A private written reprimand from a member of the core team to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the core team member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email.
- A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred. The core team may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
- An imposed "time out" from online spaces. A member of the core team will communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Agape community spaces. The core team will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a code of conduct as reviewed or otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the core team will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The core team member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the core team is not required to act on this feedback.
